Classify if a customer is going to churn or not 
The customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon whereby a customer leaves a company. Some studies confirmed that acquiring new customers can cost five times more than satisfying and retaining existing customers. As a matter of fact, there are a lot of benefits that encourage the tracking of the customer churn rate.
In this project our goal is to predict the probability of a customer is likely to churn or not using machine learning techniques.
